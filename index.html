    <h1>Sirui Zhang</h1>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sirui Zhang â€” a Cognitive Science senior at UC San Diego with a specialization in Machine Learning and a minor in Data Science. Iâ€™m passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights and building human-centered AI solutions that create real-world impact.
Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve explored the intersection of technology, behavior, and business â€” from developing AI-driven tools at Helport AI, to designing data monitoring systems during my internship at Alphabet Inc., and conducting research on cognitive models and reasoning at UCSDâ€™s Cognitive Science Lab.
    
    I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and enjoy managing cross-functional projects that combine analytics, innovation, and meaningful user experience. My career goal is to become a data science leader who advances responsible, impactful AI systems in fields like customer intelligence, accessibility, and public good.
    
    When Iâ€™m not coding or analyzing datasets, youâ€™ll find me sketching, reading about behavioral science, or catching the sunset at La Jolla Shores.
    
    ðŸ“¬ Letâ€™s connect â€” whether you're interested in working together, chatting about data science, or grabbing coffee to brainstorm creative ideas. </p>
